### Installing LabVIEW 2019

**NOTE: These commands were meant to be done through an SSH connection to the LattePanda from a remote computer. They can be done from the Desktop GUI as well with slight modfication. I reccomend doing them on the LattePanda and NOT on a remote connection.**

A step by step guide that tell you how to install LabVIEW 2019.

1. Open a terminal on your local computer and SSH into the LattePanda.
```
ssh [USER]@[IP_ADDRESS]
```

2. Install the Linux command.
```
sudo zypper in git
```

3. Open a different terminal than your current SSH terminal (leave it open). In the new terminal, copy the LabVIEW iso file from your local computer onto the LattePanda.
```
scp LabVIEW2019SP1f1Patch.dmg [USER]@[IP_ADDRESS]:/home/[USER]]/Downloads
scp lv2019full-linux-mac.iso [USER]@[IP_ADDRESS]:/home/[USER]/Downloads
```
3. Go back to the terminal that has the SSH connection open. Install LabVIEW using installation script located in the this repository.
```
sh install_labview.sh
```
4. Check if LabVIEW has been installed. Either open LabVIEW on the LattePanda GUI or check if the command below runs in the terminal.
```
./labview
```
